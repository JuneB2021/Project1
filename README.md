# Pay Rate Projections in Texas
This is an analytical review of the Texas Job market focusing on the aspects of projecting wages for companies for unforseen circumstances. Taking into account the different factors from the pandemic that occured in 2019 - 2021(Current Year) it is best to utilize this information to focus on any future projections and budgetting for a specified industry. Our hope is that we can provide this data and information as a tool for companies to project their future budget to protect their employees, and future staff from unforeseen circumstances in the market. This may include but not limited to: Unemployment, Inflation, and other items that will be presented on the presentation (Link here - to be added), and business proposal (Link Here - to be added). Under these considerations and thoughts, the idea is to project far enough in the future (2-5 years) to where a company can properly budget based on our analysis. We will be using a Monte Carlo Simulation to facilitate with this information, provided with statistical analysis from the US Labor Market, Texas Labor Market, and a variety of sourced and inputs to best provide a projection for a specified industry.
